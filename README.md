Analysis of political donations by American sports owners

This was my first data science project. I tried to implement lots of different plots to see which ones are most effective for storytelling. Lots of learning was 
done through this project in terms of coding in python. At the time, Ihad only taken introductory statistics so I was not able to implement advanced statistical techniques 
in the project. Consequently, most of the analysis is descriptive as opposed to inferential. 

Nevertheless, this project displays my ability to write scalable code in python and utilize visualization techniques.
